# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

This project focuses on predicting the *Selling_Price* of copper products and classifying leads as either *WON* or *LOST*. The goal is to create machine learning models that can effectively address challenges such as data skewness, noise, and improve decision-making in the copper manufacturing industry.

## Overview

- **Price Prediction:** Regression model to predict *Selling_Price* of copper products.
- **Lead Classification:** Classification model to predict whether a lead will be *WON* or *LOST*.
- **Interactive Web App:** A Streamlit-based app to provide real-time predictions for both *Selling_Price* and *Status*.
